title: "AVL Tree"
---

A tree is an **AVL Tree** if it is binary search tree and AVL balanced.

-   We first define the balance factor = #nodes of right subtree -  #nodes of left subtree
-   **AVL balanced** means that each node of this tree satisfied balance factor in range $[-1, 1]$
-   we also call balance factor in range $[-1, 1]$ as **AVL invariant**
