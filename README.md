Built by [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides). This doc is now used to back up, and might exist lots of chinese content. The exist course content might be rewrite.

## Contributions Instruction

see [Docusaurus Guides](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides) for implementation details.


## Issues

Because most of the content is written based on my own experience, there will always be many deep-rooted wrong ideas. For these contents, you are welcome to submit an for discussion, or if you are a UofT student who has a deep understanding to the course and you are welcome to submit your own notes. 

## Declaration

All note files are summarized by the author or other collaborators based on the course content. For other item not show in page but in repo, they are all for my own academic use. Other uploaders should also agree when uploading files that they will not violate the requirements of the course and the copyright of the instructor.

## Alternatives

There is some alternatives ways to take notes in markdown and deploy them to GitHub page.

- [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). May need to learn some ruby (generally no).
<!-- - [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Use react to build the page. -->
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), Use python. [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is a good theme.
- [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), no need to learn any new language, but it is not free for some features.
