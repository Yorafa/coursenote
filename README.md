## Issues

Because most of the content is written based on my own experience, there will always be many deep-rooted wrong ideas. For these contents, you are welcome to submit an [Issue](https://github.com/Yorafa/Course-Note/issues) for discussion, or if you are a UofT student who has a deep understanding to the course and you are welcome to submit your own notes. 

## Declaration

All note files are summarized by the author or other collaborators based on the course content. For other item not show in page but in repo, they are all for my own academic use. Other uploaders should also agree when uploading files that they will not violate the requirements of the course and the copyright of the instructor.
