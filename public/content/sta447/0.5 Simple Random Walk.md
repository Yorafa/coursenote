# Simple Random Walk

Let the state space be $\mathcal{S} = \Z$, a process $X_t$ has probability $p$ moving forward and probability $1-p$ moving backward (i.e. $p_{i, i+1} = p$ and $p_{i, i-1} = 1-p$). The process is called a **simple random walk**.

In case to know if such process is transient, positive recurrent or negative recurrent, we do following:

Let $z$ be arbitrary state, then for each state $x$ we denote $\alpha(x) = P(X_n = z \text{ for some } n\ge 0|X_0 = x)$. Then we have $a(x) = (1-p)\alpha(x-1) + p\alpha(x+1)$.

To solve this difference equation we have
