# CSC413 Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Instructor: [Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/), [Bo Wang](https://lmp.utoronto.ca/faculty/bo-wang)

Course Overview:

> It is very hard to hand design programs to solve many real world problems, e.g. distinguishing images of cats v.s. dogs. Machine learning algorithms allow computers to learn from example data, and produce a program that does the job. Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithm originally inspired by the brain, but which have recently have seen a lot of success at practical applications. They’re at the heart of production systems at companies like Google and Facebook for image processing, speech-to-text, and language understanding. This course gives an overview of both the foundational ideas and the recent advances in neural net algorithms.
