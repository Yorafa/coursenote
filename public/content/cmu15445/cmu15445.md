https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2023/

Instructors: [Andy Pavlo](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/), [Jignesh Patel](https://jigneshpatel.org/)

Course Overview:

> This course is on the design and implementation of database management systems. Topics include data models (relational, document, key/value), storage models (n-ary, decomposition), query languages (SQL, stored procedures), storage architectures (heaps, log-structured), indexing (order preserving trees, hash tables), transaction processing (ACID, concurrency control), recovery (logging, checkpoints), query processing (joins, sorting, aggregation, optimization), and parallel architectures (multi-core, distributed). Case studies on open-source and commercial database systems are used to illustrate these techniques and trade-offs. The course is appropriate for students that are prepared to flex their strong systems programming skills.

Recommended Textbook:

- [Database System Concepts Seventh Edition](https://www.db-book.com/)
