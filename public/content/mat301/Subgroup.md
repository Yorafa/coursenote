# Subgroup

**Subgroup**: $H\sube G$ and $H$ is a group with respect the binary operation on $G$

-   e.g. $(\Z_6, 0, +)$ has subgroups $(\{0\}, 0, +)$, $(\Z_6, 0, +)$, $(\{0,2,4\}, 0, +)$, $

**Subgroup Test:** Let $G$ be a group

-    let $H\sube G$ be a subset. If $\forall a,b \in H, a\cdot b^{-1} \in H$, $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. (One-step test)
-    Let $H$ be nonempty subset of $G$. $a,b\in H, ab\in H \and a^{-1}\in H \implies H$ is a subgroup of $G$  (two-step test)
-    Let $H$ be nonempty finite subset of $G$. If $H$ is closed under the operation of $G$, $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. (finite subgroup test)
-    The center of  $G$ is a subgroup of $G$
-    The centralizer of $G$ is a subgroup of $G$

$H$ is a normal subgroup of $G \iff \forall g\in G, gHg^{-1} = H$. Denote $H  \vartriangleleft G$
