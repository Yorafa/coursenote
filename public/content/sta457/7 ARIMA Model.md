# ARIMA Model

For a stationary time series without trends or seasonal effects, or we say, any trends, seasonal or cyclical effects have already been removed from the series, we might construct a linear model for a time series with autocorrelation. That is, ARIMA model is frequently used for time series without trends or seasonal effects.

The time series must satisfy the following conditions to be able to use ARIMA model:

1. The time series must be **stationary**. That is, the mean, statistical equilibrium with probabilistic properties that do not change over time, in particular varying about a fixed constant mean level and with constant variance.
2. The time series must be **invertible** where its weights decline (does not depend on the time), and use Box-Jenkins method to express time series as a function of past observations.
