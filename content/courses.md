# Course Notes

This page lists all the courses I have taken or am currently taking.  The notes may not complete and may not meant to be a substitute for the course material. They are just my personal notes that I have taken while taking the course. I have also included the links to the course material if it is available online.

Any issues, suggestion, typos or corrections are welcome. Please feel free to contact me, or create an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Yorafa/coursenote)
