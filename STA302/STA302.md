<h1><center>STA302 Method of Data Analysis I</h1></center>

Instructor: [**Katherine Daignault**](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/katherine-daignault)

Prerequisite: STA238/STA248/STA255/STA261/ECO227 (Some courses about Probability and Statistics); CSC108/CSC110/CSC120/CSC148 (Some courses about programming basics); MAT221/MAT223/MAT240 (Some courses about linear algebra)

Notice: R Language is required to use for this course

Course Overview: The course provides a solid introduction to data analysis with a focus on the theory and application of linear regression. Topics to be covered include: initial examination of data, correlation, simple and multiple regression models using least squares, inference for regression parameters for normally distributed errors, confidence and prediction intervals, model diagnostics and remedial measures when the model assumptions are violated, interactions and dummy variables, ANOVA, and model selection and validation.
