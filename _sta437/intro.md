**Multivariate Data:** the data include measurements on many variables.

It used widely:

-   Data reduction: representing data as simply as possible without sacrificing valuable information
-   Prediction: predicting the values of one or several variables based on observing the other variables
-   Classification: rules for classifying objects into well-defined groups
-   Investigating dependencies: the nature of the relationship among variables in terms of mutual independence, dependence

We can obvious find that machine learning is highly correlated with multivariate data application.

In this course we use $V$ instead $Var$
