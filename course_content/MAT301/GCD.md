## GCD

GCD(Great Common Divisor):

-   $gcd(a,b)=d \implies \exist n,m\in \Z, an + bm = d$
-   let $n,m \in \Z, \min(an+bm) = gcd(a,b)$

Co-prime:

-   $gcd(a,b) = 1 \implies a,b$ are co-prime

## LCM

LCM(Least Common Multiple):

-   $lcm(a,b) = d$ means $k_1a = k_2b =d$ and $d$ is the smallest positive integer.
