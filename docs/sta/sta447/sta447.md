# STA447 Stochastic Processe

Instructor: [Omidali (Omid) Aghababaei Jazi](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/math-cs-stats/people/omidali-omid-aghababaei-jazi)

Course Overview:

> Discrete and continuous time processes with an emphasis on Markov, Gaussian and renewal processes. Martingales and further limit theorems. A variety of applications taken from some of the follow- ing areas are discussed in the context of stochastic modeling: Information Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Analyses of Stochastic Processes, Population Growth Models, Reliability, Queuing Models, Stochastic Calculus, Sim- ulation (Monte Carlo Methods).


Recommend Textbook:

- A First Look at Stochastic Processes, by J.S. Rosenthal, 2019.

Most of STA447 contents are learnt from sta347, such as [Markov Chain](../sta347/6%20Markov%20Chain) ans [some Stochastic Process](../sta347/5%20Stochastic%20Process)
