## Project

### UTLeetcoder:
**Situation**: While studying data structures, I frequently used Leetcode to solidify my understanding. However, I noticed that Leetcode lacks detailed statistics on questions completed daily or weekly. To address this, my roommates and I decided to develop a web application to help users effectively track their daily problem-solving progress.
**Task**: During the design phase, I took responsibility for creating a clean and user-friendly interface while ensuring efficient data processing and synchronization. My roommates primarily focused on backend data handling.
**Action**:
- For the frontend, I used React with Ant Design, which significantly sped up the component design process. Initially, we planned to use Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB for the backend, but to reduce costs, we opted to serialize and store data on GitHub instead of using a database.
- I also established a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated data fetching, processing, and deployment on GitHub Pages.
**Result**: After the app launched, it attracted over 30 users, who provided positive feedback, noting that the app greatly improved their ability to track progress and manage study time efficiently.

**Situation**: 我在学习数据结构的时候，经常使用Leetcode做题来巩固自己的理解。但我发现Leetcode并不会提供具体的信息例如一天或者一周做了多少题。于是我找到了我的室友们准备一起开发一款网页应用，用来帮助用户有效地追踪他们的日常做题任务。
**Task**: 在进行设计后，我进行了分工。我负责设计一个简洁易用的用户界面，同时保证应用在数据处理和同步方面的高效性。而我的室友们则主要负责后端的数据处理。
**Action**:
- 我的前端使用React框架，并使用Ant Design大大缩短了我设计component的时间，原本后端准备使用Express.js + Node.js + MongoDB搭建，但为了降低成本，我们决定舍去了db并将数据序列化存储在Github上。
- 我还制定了CI Pipeline，利用GitHub Actions进行数据的自动抓取与处理，并自动部署在Github page上。
**Result**: 应用成功上线后，有30多位用户使用并给出了积极反馈。他们表示应用显著提升了他们追踪做题进度的效率，帮助他们更好地管理学习时间。

### UTodo:
**Situation**: After each assignment release, I spent significant time manually calculating my course grades and their impact on my overall GPA. To streamline this, I developed a grade management application aimed at helping users efficiently track and manage their academic progress.
**Task**: I was responsible for designing the data model and user interface, as well as defining backend API standards to ensure efficient data processing and synchronization across the application.
**Action**:
- I developed the frontend using React and Material UI, which significantly reduced design time, and built the backend using Django Rest Framework with PostgreSQL to handle potential large data demands.
- The frontend was deployed on GitHub Pages, while the backend was hosted on a local server.
- Additionally, I implemented an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to ensure continuous integration and reliable deployment.
**Result**: Although the app was successfully launched, user feedback revealed low engagement with this type of product. This experience taught me a valuable lesson: in future projects, a deeper understanding of user needs and practical usage scenarios is crucial to designing products with higher utility and appeal.

**Situation**: 每次作业出分后，我都需要花费大量时间手动计算这门课的总分及其对总体成绩的影响。为此，我开发了一款课程分数管理应用，帮助用户更高效地跟踪和管理学习成绩。
**Task**: 我负责设计数据模型和用户界面，并制定了后端API规范，确保数据处理的高效性和系统同步的一致性。
**Action**:
- 使用React框架和Material UI完成前端开发，大大缩短了组件设计时间；后端采用Django Rest Framework，结合PostgreSQL以应对大数据量的处理需求。
- 应用通过GitHub Pages部署前端，后端托管在本地服务器上。
- 通过GitHub Actions设置自动化CI/CD流程，确保代码持续集成与稳定部署。
**Result**: 尽管应用成功发布，用户反馈显示此类产品的使用频率较低，给了我一个重要启示：在设计产品时需要更深入地理解用户需求和实际使用场景，以提高产品的实用性和吸引力。
### LC-rating:
**Situation**: While using an open-source application, I noticed that data updates were slow and lacked some desired functionalities.
**Task**: To improve user experience, I added a target page-switching feature and wrote scripts for automating data processing to enhance update efficiency.
**Action**:
-  **Frontend Feature Enhancement**: Using TypeScript with the NEXT.js framework, I implemented a "switch target page" button, binding it to the corresponding data processing logic to enhance response time and ease of navigation.
-  **Backend Data Processing Optimization**: I created a Python script leveraging the `requests` and `gql` libraries to call LeetCode’s GraphQL API, enabling automatic data retrieval and processing. This update significantly improved data synchronization and addressed the delay in data updates.
**Result**: My contributions helped the project increase from around 100 stars to 224 stars, receiving positive feedback from the community, who noted improved usability and responsiveness.

**Situation**: 在使用一款开源应用时，我发现数据更新缓慢，并且缺少一些我认为实用的功能。
**Task**: 为了提升用户体验，我新增了切换目标页面的功能，并编写了自动处理数据的脚本，以提升应用的数据更新效率。
**Action**:
- 利用NEXT.js框架的TypeScript脚本，我设计并实现了一个“切换目标页面”的按钮，将其绑定至相关的数据处理逻辑，从而提升了页面切换的响应速度和便捷性。
- 我编写了一个Python脚本，利用`requests`和`gql`库调用LeetCode的GraphQL API来自动获取并处理数据。这些脚本不仅提高了数据同步的效率，还解决了数据更新不及时的问题。
**Result**: 我提交的贡献帮助该项目从原本的约100个Star增长到了224个，得到了社区用户的积极反馈，表明这些功能显著提高了应用的实用性和响应速度。

### Analysis of BERT and LSTM based Models on multi-label coding questions classification
**Situation**: Our goal was to design a prediction model for algorithm and data structure tags to aid in solving programming problems. To achieve this, we decided to explore neural network-based solutions.
**Task**: Gather data and analyze LSTM and BERT models to determine which model is more suitable for this tagging task.
**Action**:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Retrieved a pre-processed dataset from Kaggle and used a Python script to collect programming questions along with their corresponding algorithm and data structure tags. Further data cleaning and processing were performed to prepare it for model training.
2. **Model Building and Training**:
    - Used the PyTorch library to load and fine-tune a pre-trained CodeBERT transformer model to predict question tags.
    - Built an LSTM model with Keras, trained it on the same dataset, and adjusted model parameters. Both models were fine-tuned and then compared on the same task.
**Result**: Experimental results showed that the BERT model outperformed the LSTM model in tag prediction accuracy.
