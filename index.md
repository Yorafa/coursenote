# Course Note

Currently, only few courses' notes available:
- [CSC209](./course_content/CSC209/CSC209): Software Tools and Systems Programming

Also, welcome to [Yorafa's Home](https://yorafa.com/) my personal blog to see few more things other than the stuff from school
## Issues

Because most of the content is written based on my own experience, there will always be many deep-rooted wrong ideas. For these contents, you are welcome to submit an [Issue](https://github.com/Yorafa/Course-Note/issues) for discussion, or if you are a UofT student who has a deep understanding to the course and you are welcome to submit your own notes.

## Contribute

Before everything start, ensure followed [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) instruction to set up all service, such as node.js, npm, ruby, gem, jekyll. Then fork the [code](https://github.com/Yorafa/Course-Note) into your computer.

If want to contribute course-related notes, then go to `course_content` directory and then update the course main page(e.g. `MAT337/MAT337.md`)  and `Course-Note/index.md` if needed to access the new page.

Then go to the `Course-Note` directory open terminal, type `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see if everything worked well, then open pull request for those new updates.

## Declaration

All note files are summarized by the author or other collaborators based on the course content.
Uploaders agree when uploading files that they will not violate the requirements of the course and the copyright of the instructor.
